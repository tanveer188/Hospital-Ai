## üéØ Problem Statement

### Objective
Design and implement a multi-agent AI system to simulate an Agentic AI workforce for hospital workflows.

### Scope
- Appointment scheduling
- EMR data retrieval
- Billing validation

### Requirements
- Agents should be autonomous
- Agents should communicate with each other
- Agents should collectively complete tasks

### Expected Outcome
End-to-end working demo with 2-3 agents automating tasks like patient appointment booking, EMR fetching, and billing information validation.

## üîç Solution Architecture

Our solution consists of two core modules:

### Module 1: Multi-Agent System
A network of specialized AI agents that work together to handle different aspects of hospital workflows:
- Supervisor Agent: Orchestrates the workflow between different agents
- Booking Agent: Handles appointment scheduling
- EMR Agent: Retrieves patient medical history
- Billing Validation Agent: Verifies billing information

The agents leverage:
- Long-term memory
- Keyword memory
- Short-term memory
- User authorization

### Module 2: AI Call Agent
An intelligent voice assistant that can:
- Process incoming calls using Azure Speech-to-Text
- Schedule, reschedule, or cancel appointments
- Handle billing validation
- Send SMS notifications and payment links via Twilio
- Convert responses back to speech

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Voice & Communication
- Google Speech-to-Text
- ElevenLabs
- Twilio

### AI Orchestration & Interaction
- LangGraph
- LangChain
- OpenAI LLMs
- MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- Selenium and Playwright

### Data Management
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Vector DB (e.g., Pinecone)

## üîë Key Technologies

### LangGraph
LangGraph uses a graph-based workflow where each node is an agent or function, and edges define communication. This ensures controlled management of interactions and data flow.

### MCP Protocol
MCP (Model Context Protocol) connects AI agents, linking each model with online data and useful tools.

## üí™ Impact and Societal Benefits

- **Accessibility**: Multilingual AI with phone/web modes ensures everyone‚Äîurban or rural‚Äîcan use it
- **Patient Understanding**: Quick EMR insights for better understanding
- **Personalized Support**: Custom chatbots for each patient to assist doctors in decision-making
- **Inclusivity**: Hindi speech support enhances rural reach
- **Efficiency**: Reduces patient wait times and staff workload

## üîÆ Future Roadmap

- **National Integration**: Seamless EMR access via Arogya Setu / Ayushman Bharat
- **Multi-model Integration**: Analyze EMR data including lab reports, X-rays, CT scans, and diagnostic records
- **Multilingual Support**: Expand to regional languages (Marathi, Tamil, Bengali, etc.)
- **IoT Integration**: Sync health vitals from smartwatches for real-time monitoring
- **Blockchain Security**: Ensure secure, tamper-proof medical data storage
- **Prescription Intelligence**: Validate prescriptions, check drug conflicts, allergies, and side effects
- **Private LLM**: Local LLM integration for enhanced security and privacy of patient data
